Abstract:
We develop shopper, a sequential probabilistic model of shopping data.
shopper uses interpretable components to model the forces that drive how
a customer chooses products; in particular, we designed shopper to capture
how items interact with other items. We develop an efficient posterior inference
algorithm to estimate these forces from large-scale data, and we analyze a large
dataset from a major chain grocery store. We are interested in answering counterfactual queries about changes in prices. We found that shopper provides
accurate predictions even under price interventions, and that it helps identify
complementary and substitutable pairs of products.
